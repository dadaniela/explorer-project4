Explorer is a series of different projects I’m building to learn web development from HTML and CSS to JS and ReactJS whilst also practicing UX/UI design and accessibility concepts.
It’s one of the courses offered by [rocketseat.com.br](https://rocketseat.com.br)

### Project 04
This project is a simple home page to practice placing content in a responsive website respecting design principles such as balance, proportion and space.
